# MapTheMasses
Map the Masses is a project that attempts to provide a framework for crowdsourcing pedestrian movement data using mobile technology.
The project also provides a clear visualization of this data in the form of heatmaps. 
Map the Masses then explores applications of this data by looking at an algorithmic approach to identifying useful features and 
details such as crosswalks and sidewalks. A crowd sensitive route finding feature is also included. 
The application attempts to keep pedestrians as informed of their surroundings as possible in order to maximize safety and utility.
